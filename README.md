# UNCW-FRF-MSGEO-Final-Project

Hello!

My name is Connor Geis. I am a UNCW graduate student working at the United States Army Corps Field Research Facility in Duck, NC. 
This repository is a collection of codes, figures, images, and slides that I have worked on while helping with a global citizen science project called CoastSnap that utilizes photogrammetry and cell phone technology to track shoreline change.
